Some useful JS scripts to survive this cruel world

Force Background is a script that forces all elements on the screen to set the nice old-paper color as the background. 

To install the script 'ForceTheBackground' you need to have browser extension Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey installed.
Tampermonkey is for Chrome, Greasemonkey is for Safari. They work on another browsers as well, but it's up to you which one
to prefer.
