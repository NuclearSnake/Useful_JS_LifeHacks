## Some useful JS scripts to survive this cruel world

### Contents:
* **Force Background** is a script that forces all elements on the screen to set the nice old-paper color as the background. 

--------------

To install some of the scripts below you will need to have a browser extension Tampermonkey installed (Greasemonkey may work but haven't tested). Tampermonkey is a browser extension which enables an option to add custom functionality or style to all websites or some specific ones. Here is a link where you can find the version for your web browser: https://tampermonkey.net/. Please note, that some of the links won't work until you have some script manager installed (e.g. Tampermonkey).

### Force Background
This script makes websites look nicely for your tired eyes. Developed when I couldn't stand it longer.

* You need Tampermonkey in order to install this.
* Please click the following link to install or update the script: https://github.com/NuclearSnake/Useful_JS_LifeHacks/raw/master/ForceBackground.user.js

#### **NOTE! This script makes some sites not nice to use! So feel free to turn on/off the script at any time in the top right corner with Tampermonkey (or another script manager) icon.**
